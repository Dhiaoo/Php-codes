# Php-codes
In this repositery i will share some code of php that i've used in personal project 
I was working in a personal project (E-Commerce) and i've build a simple logic for the log in 
page, Were i programme it to check the input of user (email, password) (i've filter them a simple filtering that trim the spaces and strip the slaches ), 
if it match the credentiales or not , then if the credential match and he was the admin it will redirect him to the dashboard page ,
if it was a simple user it will redirect him to the index page .
so that's it , D'ON'T FORGET TO LEAVE A STAR !!!!
